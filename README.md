## **Core Features**

*   **Multiple Operating Modes**: Seamlessly switch between **Backtesting**, **Paper Trading**, and **Live Trading**.
*   **Modular and Extensible Architecture**: Clean separation of concerns (data, strategy, execution, risk, visualization) makes the code easy to maintain and extend.[1]
*   **High-Performance Backtesting**: Leverages the powerful `backtrader` engine for robust event-driven simulations and `numpy`/`pandas` for fast, vectorized analysis.
*   **Indian Market Specifics**: Pre-configured for NSE indices like **NIFTY**, **BANKNIFTY**, and **FINNIFTY**, with correct lot sizes, expiry conventions, and brokerage simulation.
*   **Advanced Strategy Support**: Comes with pre-built templates for common options strategies (Straddle, Iron Condor) and technical indicator-based models (RSI Momentum).
*   **Integrated Risk Management**: Features built-in controls for Value-at-Risk (VaR), maximum drawdown limits, and position sizing to enforce trading discipline.
*   **Interactive Visualizations**: Generates rich, interactive reports using `Plotly` for detailed performance analysis, including equity curves, drawdown charts, and key metrics.
*   **Real-Time Connectivity**: Integrates with the **Zerodha Kite API** for both paper trading (sandbox) and live trade execution via a WebSocket connection.

## **Architecture Overview**

The platform is designed as a modular system where each component has a specific responsibility:

*   `main.py`: The central entry point that parses command-line arguments and orchestrates the application flow.
*   `config.yaml`: A centralized YAML file for all user-configurable parameters, including API keys, trading symbols, and risk settings.
*   `data_fetcher.py`: Handles all data-related tasks, including generating sample historical data and fetching live data streams.
*   `financial_math.py`: Contains pure mathematical functions for options pricing (Black-Scholes), Greeks calculation, and Implied Volatility (IV) solving.
*   `strategy_engine.py`: Defines the base strategy class and implementations of specific trading algorithms using `backtrader`.
*   `execution_engine.py`: Manages order placement, modification, and cancellation for paper and live trading modes via the broker API.
*   `risk_management.py`: Enforces portfolio-level and trade-level risk rules before and during trade execution.
*   `visualizations.py`: Generates all charts and reports for performance analysis.
*   `tests/`: A dedicated directory for unit tests to ensure the correctness of critical components like financial calculations.

## **Technology Stack**

The platform is built using Python 3.12 and a minimal set of powerful, pre-approved libraries. No other external dependencies are required.

*   **Core Language**: Python 3.12
*   **Data Manipulation**: `pandas`, `numpy`
*   **Backtesting Engine**: `backtrader`
*   **Technical Analysis**: `ta-lib`
*   **API Communication**: `requests`, `asyncio`
*   **Visualization**: `plotly`, `matplotlib`
*   **Configuration**: `pyyaml`
*   **Broker API**: `kiteconnect`

## **Installation and Setup**

1.  **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/options-trading-platform.git
    cd options-trading-platform
    ```

2.  **Prerequisites**:
    Ensure you have Python 3.12+ installed. The platform relies on a specific set of libraries that must be present in your environment.

3.  **Install Dependencies**:
    You can install all required packages using `pip`:
    ```bash
    pip install pandas numpy matplotlib plotly TA-Lib backtrader requests pyyaml kiteconnect
    ```
    > **Note on TA-Lib**: The `TA-Lib` library can have a complex installation process as it depends on the underlying C library. Please follow the [official TA-Lib installation guide](https://mrjbq7.github.io/ta-lib/install.html) for your operating system **before** running the pip command.

## **Configuration**

All platform settings are managed centrally in the `config.yaml` file. Before running the application, you must configure it properly:[3]

1.  **API Credentials (for Paper/Live Trading)**:
    *   Create an app on the [Zerodha Kite Connect Developer](https://kite.trade) portal to get your `api_key` and `api_secret`.
    *   Generate a daily `access_token` using the Kite Connect API flow.
    *   Update these values in `config.yaml`.

    > **üîí Security Best Practice**: The `config.yaml` provides a simple Base64 encoding for the API secret as a placeholder. In a production environment, **never store plain-text secrets in configuration files**. Use a secure secret management system like HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, or environment variables.

2.  **Trading Parameters**:
    *   Adjust symbols (`NIFTY`, `BANKNIFTY`), default capital, and other parameters to fit your trading plan.

## **How to Run the Platform**

The application is run from the command line via the `main.py` script. The two main arguments are `--mode` and `--strategy`.

#### **1. Generate Sample Data**

For backtesting, you need historical data. The platform includes a script to generate a sample one-year, 1-minute OHLC dataset for the NIFTY index.

```bash
python data_fetcher.py --generate-sample-data
```

This command will create a file named `nifty_options_data.csv` in your project's root directory.

#### **2. Run a Backtest**

Execute a strategy against the historical dataset to evaluate its performance without any financial risk.

```bash
python main.py --mode backtest --strategy straddle --symbol NIFTY --capital 100000
```

*   `--mode backtest`: Runs the backtesting engine.
*   `--strategy straddle`: Specifies the strategy to test.
*   `--symbol NIFTY`: Defines the underlying instrument.
*   `--capital 100000`: Sets the initial virtual capital for the simulation.

The backtest will print a performance summary to the console and generate an interactive HTML report named `backtest_report.html`.

#### **3. Run in Paper Trading Mode**

Simulate live trading using the Zerodha Kite Connect sandbox environment. This mode connects to the live market data feed but executes trades against a virtual account.

```bash
python main.py --mode paper --strategy rsi_momentum --symbol BANKNIFTY
```

All actions, including order placements and strategy signals, will be logged in `trading_platform.log`.

#### **4. Run in Live Trading Mode**

> **‚ö†Ô∏è EXTREME CAUTION**: This mode executes **real trades with real money** in your brokerage account. Ensure your strategy, risk parameters, and API configuration are flawless before proceeding.

First, run with the `--dry-run` flag to verify the logic without sending orders to the exchange:

```bash
python main.py --mode live --strategy iron_condor --symbol NIFTY --dry-run
```

Once you are confident, remove the `--dry-run` flag to go live. The application will require explicit confirmation before activating.

```bash
python main.py --mode live --strategy iron_condor --symbol NIFTY
```

## **Available Strategies**

The platform comes with three pre-built strategies in `strategy_engine.py`:

*   `straddle`: A classic non-directional volatility strategy that buys an at-the-money (ATM) call and put.
*   `iron_condor`: A range-bound, risk-defined strategy that profits from low volatility.
*   `rsi_momentum`: A directional strategy that enters trades based on signals from the Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicator.

## **Extending the Platform**

The modular design makes it easy to add new functionalities.

#### **Adding a New Strategy**

1.  Open `strategy_engine.py`.
2.  Create a new class that inherits from `BaseStrategy`.
3.  Implement your trading logic within the `next()` method, which is called on every new bar of data.
4.  Use `self.buy()` or `self.sell()` to create orders.
5.  Import and register your new strategy class in `main.py`'s `strategy_map`.

## **Running Unit Tests**

To ensure the core financial calculations are accurate, you can run the provided unit tests:

```bash
python -m unittest tests/test_financial_math.py
```
